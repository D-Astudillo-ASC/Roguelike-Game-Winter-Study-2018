# Design Doc for The Last Stand

### Goals

The Last Stand is a fairly standard, simple roguelike. As such, the player gets
* character advancement/progression (on the mechanics side of things, not necessarily the story side)
  * some opponents that are too challenging to fight in the early stages of the game are easy to beat by the later stages of the game
* inventory management
* primary mob interactions are combat ('attack it' is never a bad choice from a story standpoint)
  * some tactically interesting combat
    * at the very least, players must make decisions about whether to fight or flee a given opponent
* exploration (of procedurally generated content)
* a simple framing story to engage the player and justify the avatar actions, but nothing to deep and little in the way of narrative progression
* a final battle/goal
* other standard roguelike experiences (permadeath, turn-based action, etc.)

### Story

Decades of nuclear conflict have rendered the surface uninhabitable, mostly condemned to permanent desolation. There were a few brave souls, determined to endure their irradiated surroundings and resist the Underground, who continued to lead their lives on the surface, until they could bear no longer; the effects of several years worth of exposure to fatal levels of radiation were unexpectedly brought upon the population. Within days, the bodies of the most stubborn survivors disintegrated; they dissolved away, along with their "protective" gear, and were lost forever. Meanwhile, the Underground has started to sustain considerable damage from corrosive radiation seeping down from the surface, rapidly approaching a state of chaos that resembles the surfaces. Within weeks, you lose your immediate family, your home, and are forced to venture beyond the walls of the Bunker. From here, your journey takes off, and you hear of a hidden location on the surface that is considered a haven for survivors; you become determined to search for the map all throughout the Underground, encountering mutants, disease, and radiation, dodging death with every step. At the moment, the only thing on your mind is survival......
